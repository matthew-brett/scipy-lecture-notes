# Control Flow

Controls the order in which the code is executed.

## if/elif/else

```{python}
if 2**2 == 4:
    print("Obvious!")
```

**Blocks are delimited by indentation**

::: {note}
:class: dropdown

Type the following lines in your Python interpreter, and be careful
to **respect the indentation depth**. The Ipython shell automatically
increases the indentation depth after a colon `:` sign; to
decrease the indentation depth, go four spaces to the left with the
Backspace key. Press the Enter key twice to leave the logical block.
:::

```{python}
a = 10
```

```{python}
if a == 1:
    print(1)
elif a == 2:
    print(2)
else:
    print("A lot")
```

Indentation is compulsory in scripts as well. As an exercise, re-type the
previous lines with the same indentation in a script `condition.py`, and
execute the script with `run condition.py` in Ipython.

## for/range

Iterating with an index:

```{python}
for i in range(4):
    print(i)
```

But most often, it is more readable to iterate over values:

```{python}
for word in ('cool', 'powerful', 'readable'):
    print('Python is %s' % word)
```

## while/break/continue

Typical C-style while loop (Mandelbrot problem):

```{python}
z = 1 + 1j
while abs(z) < 100:
    z = z**2 + 1
z
```

**More advanced features**

`break` out of enclosing for/while loop:

```{python}
z = 1 + 1j
```

```{python}
while abs(z) < 100:
    if z.imag == 0:
        break
    z = z**2 + 1
```

`continue` the next iteration of a loop.:

```{python}
a = [1, 0, 2, 4]
for element in a:
    if element == 0:
        continue
    print(1. / element)
```

## Conditional Expressions


:``a == b``:

  Tests equality, with logics::

    >>> 1 == 1.
    True

:``a is b``:

  Tests identity: both sides are the same object::

    >>> a = 1
    >>> b = 1.
    >>> a == b
    True
    >>> a is b
    False

    >>> a = 1
    >>> b = 1
    >>> a is b
    True

:``a in b``:

  For any collection ``b``: ``b`` contains ``a`` ::

    >>> b = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> 2 in b
    True
    >>> 5 in b
    False


  If ``b`` is a dictionary, this tests that ``a`` is a key of ``b``.

Advanced iteration
-------------------------

Iterate over any *sequence*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can iterate over any sequence (string, list, keys in a dictionary, lines in
a file, ...)::

## Advanced iteration

### Iterate over any *sequence*

You can iterate over any sequence (string, list, keys in a dictionary, lines in
a file, ...):

```{python}
vowels = 'aeiouy'
```

```{python}
for i in 'powerful':
    if i in vowels:
        print(i)
```

```{python}
message = "Hello how are you?"
message.split() # returns a list
```

```{python}
for word in message.split():
    print(word)
```

::: {note}
:class: dropdown

Few languages (in particular, languages for scientific computing) allow to
loop over anything but integers/indices. With Python it is possible to
loop exactly over the objects of interest without bothering with indices
you often don't care about. This feature can often be used to make
code more readable.
:::

:::{warning}
Not safe to modify the sequence you are iterating over.
:::

### Keeping track of enumeration number

Common task is to iterate over a sequence while keeping track of the
item number.

- Could use while loop with a counter as above. Or a for loop:

```{python}
words = ('cool', 'powerful', 'readable')
for i in range(0, len(words)):
    print((i, words[i]))
```

- But, Python provides a built-in function - `enumerate` - for this:

```{python}
for index, item in enumerate(words):
    print((index, item))
```

### Looping over a dictionary

Use **items**:

```{python}
d = {'a': 1, 'b':1.2, 'c':1j}
```

```{python}
for key, val in sorted(d.items()):
    print('Key: %s has value: %s' % (key, val))
```

:::{note}
The ordering of a dictionary is random, thus we use {func}`sorted`
which will sort on the keys.
:::

## List Comprehensions

Instead of creating a list by means of a loop, one can make use
of a list comprehension with a rather self-explaining syntax.

```{python}
[i**2 for i in range(4)]
```
