# Scientific Python Lectures

This repository gathers some lectures on the scientific Python
ecosystem that can be used for a full course of scientific computing with
Python.

These documents are written in Markdown and built using [Jupyter Book vversion
1](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), which, in turn, uses the
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) engine.

You can view the online version at: <https://lectures.scientific-python.org/>
