For unsupervised learning applications, this accepts only a single argument, the data ``X`` (e.g. ``model.fit(X)``). |\n",
    "| **Supervised estimators** | â¢ ``model.predict()`` : given a trained model, predict the label of a new set of data. This method accepts one argument, the new data ``X_new`` (e.g. ``model.predict(X_new)``), and returns the learned label for each object in the array.<br> â¢ ``model.predict_proba()`` : For classification problems, some estimators also provide this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by ``model.predict()``.<br> â¢ ``model.score()`` : for classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement a score method. Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.|\n",
    "| **Unsupervised estimators** | â¢ ``model.transform()`` : given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis. This also accepts one argument ``X_new``, and returns the new representation of the data based on the unsupervised model.<br> â¢ ``model.fit_transform()`` : some estimators implement this method, which more efficiently performs a fit and a transform on the same input data.|\n",

    "### Summary on model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâve seen above that an under-performing algorithm can be due to two\n",
    "possible situations: high bias (under-fitting) and high variance\n",
    "(over-fitting). In order to evaluate our algorithm, we set aside a\n",
    "portion of our training data for cross-validation. Using the technique\n",
    "of learning curves, we can train on progressively larger subsets of the\n",
    "data, evaluating the training error and cross-validation error to\n",
    "determine whether our algorithm has high variance or high bias. But what\n",
    "do we do with this information?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model shows high **bias**, the following actions might help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add more features**. In our example of predicting home prices, it\n",
    "  may be helpful to make use of information such as the neighborhood\n",
    "  the house is in, the year the house was built, the size of the lot,\n",
    "  etc. Adding these features to the training and test sets can improve\n",
    "  a high-bias estimator\n",
    "- **Use a more sophisticated model**. Adding complexity to the model\n",
    "  can help improve on bias. For a polynomial fit, this can be\n",
    "  accomplished by increasing the degree d. Each learning technique has\n",
    "  its own methods of adding complexity.\n",
    "- **Use fewer samples**. Though this will not improve the\n",
    "  classification, a high-bias algorithm can attain nearly the same\n",
    "  error with a smaller training sample. For algorithms which are\n",
    "  computationally expensive, reducing the training sample size can lead\n",
    "  to very large improvements in speed.\n",
    "- **Decrease regularization**. Regularization is a technique used to\n",
    "  impose simplicity in some machine learning models, by adding a\n",
    "  penalty term that depends on the characteristics of the parameters.\n",
    "  If a model has high bias, decreasing the effect of regularization can\n",
    "  lead to better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model shows **high variance**, the following actions might\n",
    "help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use fewer features**. Using a feature selection technique may be\n",
    "  useful, and decrease the over-fitting of the estimator.\n",
    "- **Use a simpler model**. Model complexity and over-fitting go\n",

    "- **Use more training samples**. Adding training samples can reduce the\n",
    "  effect of over-fitting, and lead to improvements in a high variance\n",

    "- **Increase Regularization**. Regularization is designed to prevent\n",
    "  over-fitting. In a high-variance model, increasing regularization can\n",
    "  lead to better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These choices become very important in real-world situations. For\n",
    "example, due to limited telescope time, astronomers must seek a balance\n",
    "between observing a large number of objects, and observing a large\n",
    "number of features for each object. Determining which is more important\n",
    "for a particular learning task can inform the observing strategy that\n",
    "the astronomer employs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A last word of caution: separate validation and test set\n",
    "\n",
    "Using validation schemes to determine hyper-parameters means that we are\n",
    "fitting the hyper-parameters to the particular validation set. In the\n",
    "same way that parameters can be over-fit to the training set,\n",
    "hyperparameters can be over-fit to the validation set. Because of this,\n",
    "the validation error tends to under-predict the classification error of\n",
    "new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is recommended to split the data into three sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **training set**, used to train the model (usually ~60% of the\n",
    "  data)\n",
    "- The **validation set**, used to validate the model (usually ~20% of\n",
    "  the data)\n",
    "- The **test set**, used to evaluate the expected error of the\n",
    "  validated model (usually ~20% of the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning practitioners do not separate test set and\n",
    "validation set. But if your goal is to gauge the error of a model on\n",
    "unknown data, using an independent test set is vital.\n",
