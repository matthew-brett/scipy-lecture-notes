    "\n",
    "- **Batteries included** Rich collection of already existing **bricks**\n",
    "  of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We\n",

    "  or a fitting algorithm. Don't reinvent the wheel!\n",
    "- **Easy to learn** Most scientists are not paid as programmers, neither\n",
    "  have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth\n",
    "  a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.\n",
    "- **Easy communication** To keep code alive within a lab or a company\n",
    "  it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or\n",
    "  maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or\n",
    "  lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from\n",
    "  mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.\n",
    "- **Efficient code** Python numerical modules are computationally\n",
    "  efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if\n",
    "  too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development\n",
