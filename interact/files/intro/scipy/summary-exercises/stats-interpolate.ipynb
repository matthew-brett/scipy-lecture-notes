    "data are only measured over 21 years at the Sprogø meteorological\n",
    "station located in Denmark. First, the statistical steps will be given\n",

    "it gives a probability from a wind speed maxima. Finding the maximum wind\n",
    "speed occurring every 50 years requires the opposite approach, the result\n",
    "needs to be found from a defined probability. That is the quantile function\n",

    "the cumulative probability of every measured wind speed maxima.\n",
    "From those experimental points, the scipy.interpolate module will be\n",
