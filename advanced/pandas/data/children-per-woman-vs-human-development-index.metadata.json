        "Each of the dimensions of the HDI is measured with four indicators: a long and healthy life is measured by _life expectancy at birth_, good education (knowledge) is measured by two indicators, _expected_ and _mean_ _years of schooling_; and a decent standard of living is measured by _Gross National Income (GNI) per capita_, logarithmized to reflect that incomes become less important as they increase.",
        "The index is then calculated by normalizing and aggregating the indicators. First, the indicators are brought onto the same scale, ranging from 0 to 1. This is done by setting minimum and maximum values for each indicator, and a country at or below the minimum value receiving a score of 0, and a country at or above the maximum value receiving a score of 1.",
        "The minimum and maximum values for each indicator are defined as follows: _Life expectancy at birth_ ranges between 20 and 85 years; _expected years of schooling_ between 0 and 18 years; _mean years of schooling_, between 0 and 15 years; and _GNI per capita_ between 100 and 75,000 international-$ at 2017 prices.",
        "The HDI is then estimated as the geometric mean of these indices, or _HDI = (Health index * Education index * Income index)^(1/3)_. The education index is the arithmetic mean (average) of the mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling."
