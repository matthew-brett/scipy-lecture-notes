    "\n",
    "Lidars systems are optical rangefinders that analyze property of scattered\n",
    "light to measure distances. Most of them emit a short light impulsion towards\n",
    "a target and record the reflected signal. This signal is then processed to\n",
    "extract the distance between the lidar system and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topographical lidar systems are such systems embedded in airborne platforms.\n",
    "They measure distances between the platform and the Earth, so as to deliver\n",
    "information on the Earth's topography (see [^mallet] for more details).\n",
