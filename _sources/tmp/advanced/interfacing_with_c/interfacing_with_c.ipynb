    "\n",
    "This chapter contains an _introduction_ to the many different routes for\n",
    "making your native code (primarily `C/C++`) available from Python, a\n",
    "process commonly referred to _wrapping_. The goal of this chapter is to\n",
    "give you a flavour of what technologies exist and what their respective\n",
    "merits and shortcomings are, so that you can select the appropriate one\n",
    "for your specific needs. In any case, once you do start wrapping, you\n",
    "almost certainly will want to consult the respective documentation for\n",
    "your selected technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python-C-Api](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/)\n",
    "- [Ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)\n",
    "- [SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)](https://www.swig.org/)\n",
    "- [Cython](https://cython.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "These four techniques are perhaps the most well known ones, of which Cython is\n",
    "probably the most advanced one and the one you should consider using first. The\n",
    "others are also important, if you want to understand the wrapping problem from\n",
    "different angles. Having said that, there are other alternatives out there,\n",
    "but having understood the basics of the ones above, you will be in a position\n",
    "to evaluate the technique of your choice to see if it fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following criteria may be useful when evaluating a technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are additional libraries required?\n",
    "- Is the code autogenerated?\n",
    "- Does it need to be compiled?\n",
    "- Is there good support for interacting with NumPy arrays?\n",
    "- Does it support C++?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you set out, you should consider your use case. When interfacing with\n",
    "native code, there are usually two use-cases that come up:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Existing code in C/C++ that needs to be leveraged, either because it already\n",
    "  exists, or because it is faster.\n",
    "- Python code too slow, push inner loops to native code\n",
    "\n",
    "Each technology is demonstrated by wrapping the `cos` function from\n",
    "`math.h`. While this is a mostly a trivial example, it should serve us well\n",
    "to demonstrate the basics of the wrapping solution. Since each technique also\n",
    "includes some form of NumPy support, this is also demonstrated using an\n",
    "example where the cosine is computed on some kind of array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, two small warnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of these techniques may crash (segmentation fault) the Python\n",
    "  interpreter, which is (usually) due to bugs in the C code.\n",
    "- All the examples have been done on Linux, they _should_ be possible on other\n",
    "  operating systems.\n",
    "- You will need a C compiler for most of the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python-C-Api\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python-C-API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/) is the backbone of the\n",
    "standard Python interpreter (a.k.a _CPython_). Using this API it is possible to\n",
    "write Python extension module in C and C++. Obviously, these extension modules\n",
    "can, by virtue of language compatibility, call any function written in C or\n",
    "C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Python-C-API, one usually writes much boilerplate code, first to\n",
    "parse the arguments that were given to a function, and later to construct the\n",
    "return type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires no additional libraries\n",
    "- Lots of low-level control\n",
    "- Entirely usable from C++\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- May require a substantial amount of effort\n",
    "- Much overhead in the code\n",
    "- Must be compiled\n",
    "- High maintenance cost\n",
    "- No forward compatibility across Python versions as C-API changes\n",
    "- Reference count bugs are easy to create and very hard to track down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start of note**\n",
    "The Python-C-Api example here serves mainly for didactic reasons. Many of\n",
    "the other techniques actually depend on this, so it is good to have a\n",
    "high-level understanding of how it works. In 99% of the use-cases you will\n",
    "be better off, using an alternative technique.\n",
    "**End of note**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start of note**\n",
    "Since reference counting bugs are easy to create and hard to track down,\n",
    "anyone really needing to use the Python C-API should read the [section\n",
    "about objects, types and reference counts](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#objects-types-and-reference-counts)\n",
    "from the official python documentation. Additionally, there is a tool by the\n",
    "name of [cpychecker](https://gcc-python-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cpychecker.html)\n",
    "which can help discover common errors with reference counting.\n",
    "**End of note**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following C-extension module, make the `cos` function from the standard\n",
    "math library available to Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} python_c_api/cos_module.c\n",
    ":language: c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there is much boilerplate, both to «massage» the arguments and\n",
    "return types into place and for the module initialisation. Although some of\n",
    "this is amortised, as the extension grows, the boilerplate required for each\n",
    "function(s) remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard python build system, `setuptools`, supports compiling\n",
    "C-extensions via a `setup.py` file:\n",

    "\n",
    "Analog to the Python-C-API, NumPy, which is itself implemented as a\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "[Ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) is a _foreign\n",

    "\n",
    "NumPy contains some support for interfacing with ctypes. In particular there is\n",

    "and [numpy.ctypeslib](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.ctypeslib.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following example, let's consider a C function in a library that takes\n",
    "an input and an output array, computes the cosine of the input array and\n",
    "stores the result in the output array.\n",

    "The library consists of the following header file (although this is not\n",

    "```{literalinclude} ctypes_numpy/cos_doubles.c\n",
    ":language: c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And since the library is pure C, we can't use `setuptools` to compile it, but\n",
    "must use a combination of `make` and `gcc`:\n",

    "```{literalinclude} ctypes_numpy/makefile\n",
    ":language: make\n",
    "```\n",
