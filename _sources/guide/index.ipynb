    ":::\n",

    "Make sure to read this [Documentation style guide] as well as these\n",
    "[tips, tricks] and conventions about documentation content and workflows.\n",

    "- If you spot typos, unclear or clumsy wording in the lectures, please\n",
    "  help to improve them. Simple text editing can be done by [editing files\n",
    "  in your GitHub fork](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) of\n",
    "  the lectures. On every html page of the lectures, an **edit**\n",
    "  button on the top right links to the editable source of the page (you still\n",
    "  need to create a fork of the project). Edit the source and choose\n",
    "  \"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a topic that is not yet covered and write it up !\n",
    "\n",
    "  First create a new issue on GitHub to explain the topic which you would\n",
    "  like to cover, in order to discuss with editors and contributors about\n",
    "  the scope of the future tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then create a new directory inside one of the chapters directories (`intro`,\n",
    "  `advanced`, or `packages`) and create a new notebook named `index` for the\n",
    "  new tutorial. Add the new file in the table of contents of the corresponding\n",
    "  chapter (in the `_toc.yml`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that tutorials are to be taught at different places and\n",
    "different parts may be combined into a course on Python for scientific\n",
    "computing. Thus you want them to be interactive and reasonably short (one\n",
    "to two hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, the goal of this material is to provide a concise\n",
    "text to learn the main features of the scientific Python ecosystem. If\n",
    "you want to contribute to reference material, we suggest that you\n",
    "contribute to the documentation of the specific packages that you are\n",
    "interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to make your own version of this teaching material\n",
    "is to fork it under GitHub, and use the git version control system to\n",
    "maintain your own fork. For this, all you have to do is create an account\n",
    "on GitHub and click on the _fork_ button, on the top right of [this\n",
    "page](https://github.com/scipy-lectures/scientific-python-lectures). You can use git to pull from your _fork_, and push back to it the\n",
    "changes. If you want to contribute the changes back, just fill a\n",
    "_pull request_, using the button on the top of your fork's page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several resources are available online to learn git and GitHub, such as\n",
    "<https://try.github.io> for complete beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refrain from modifying the Makefile unless it is absolutely\n",
    "necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping it concise: collapsing paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML output is used for displaying on screen while teaching. The goal\n",
    "is to have the same material displayed as in the notes. Thus there needs\n",
    "to be a very concise display, with bullet-lists rather than full-blown\n",
    "paragraphs and sentences. For more elaborate discussions that people can\n",
    "read and refer to, please use\n",
    "[Dropdowns](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/hiding.html#hide-markdown-using-myst-markdown).\n",
    "These create collapsible paragraphs, that can be hidden during an oral\n",
    "presentation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {toggle}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here insert a full-blown discussion, that will be collapsible in the HTML\n",
    "version.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can span on multiple paragraphs\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "This renders as a section that is only visible on clicking dropdown widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `{class} dropdown` with an admonition, for the same purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {note}\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Another discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also span on multiple paragraphs\n",

    "## Figures and code examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**We do not check figures in the repository**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any figure must be generated with code in some notebook built during the book\n",
    "build.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Markup\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main kinds of markup that should be used: _italics_, **bold**\n",
    "and `fixed-font`. _Italics_ should be used when introducing a new technical\n",
    "term, **bold** should be used for emphasis and `fixed-font` for source code.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Example:\n",
    "When using _object-oriented programming_ in Python you **must** use the\n",
    "`class` keyword to define your _classes_.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In Markdown markup this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",

    "\n",
    "## Linking to package documentations\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the Scientific Python Lectures is not to duplicate or replace\n",
    "the documentation of the various packages. You should link as much as\n",
    "possible to the original documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For cross-referencing API documentation we prefer to use the [intersphinx\n",
    "extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#built-in-extensions). This provides\n",
    "the directives `{mod}`, `{class}` and `{func}` to cross-link to modules,\n",
    "classes and functions respectively. For example the `` {func}`numpy.var` `` will\n",
    "create a link like {func}`numpy.var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter, section, subsection, paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to avoid to go below paragraph granularity or your document might become\n",
    "difficult to read:\n",
    "\n",
